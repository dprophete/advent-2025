# Advent of code - 2025

https://adventofcode.com/2025

Third year doing it. This year, there will only be 12 days. I am trying to do it all in [gleam](https://gleam.run/). Being a pure language (no side effect), it complicates things a little bit for some algorithms, but it's still a great learning exercise.

## running

Edit [src/aoc2025.gleam](./src/aoc2025.gleam) and change the day you want to run, then `gleam run` is your friend.
